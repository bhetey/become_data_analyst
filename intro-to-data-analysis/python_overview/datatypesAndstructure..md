## Data Types & Operators

- Integer `1,2,3,4,5`
- floats `1.23, 44.45, 203.67`
- strings `hello, hi there, what is new, i am a emoji, haha`
- boolean `true, false`

Operators:

- `+`
- `-`

## Variables

```python

a = 2

c = true
print(a) ## python version  3..
print a ## python version 2.7
```

## Data Structures

There are various data types in python. The most common used once are :

- `sets`
- `list`
- `array`
- `dict`
- `str`
- `tuple`

## Exercise

> For some these exercises you do not have to code them right way but it is important you write down your `pseudocode`. _`pseudocode` is a breakdown of what you want your `code` to do._

> ```python
> /*
> # you want to add 2 digits or numbers together.
> # your pseucode will look like this.
> """
>  -> get the first number
> -> get the second number
> -> using addition sign to add them together
> -> show the result of the addition """
> ```

> Question :
>
> - Write a array that contains some sets of numbers.
> - Write an expression that calculates the average of 3 numbers and print your output.

> Quiz : In the fishy situation below, some of the quantities are of type int and some are of type float. Check all the ones that should be of type float.

- [ ] How many people came on your fishing trip
- [ ] Length of a fish you caught, in meters
- [ ] Number of fish caught on a fishing trip
- [ ] Length of time it took to catch the first fish, in hours

> What happens if you divide by zero in Python? Try it out! Test run this code and see what happens.

````python
  print(5/0) ```

> Quiz: What Type Do These Objects Have?
>
> - What type does this object have? `'12'`.
> - What type does this object have? `12.3`
> - What type does this object have? `len("my_string")`
> - What type does this object have? `"hippo" * 16`
