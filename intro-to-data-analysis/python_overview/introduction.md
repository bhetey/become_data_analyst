# Introduction to Python: Overview

[`Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.`](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>)

## Understanding the misconception between **`ML, DL & AI`**

The misconception around AI, ML and DL are increasing every day.
After doing some researches and asking questions about what people think these 3 terms are, I came to a conclusion that they are been misunderstood. Do you know what they mean apparently?

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: is an of making machines behave and react like humans. That is humans program this machines to make them think and act like us. According to Wikipedia, it is a simulation of human intelligence.

- **Machine Learning (ML)**: is a part of AI that involves the use of statistics to teach a computer how to learn or tool used to teach machine making use of traditional machine learning algorithms. ML is almost similar to computational statistics. For more reading, visit ML Wikipedia

- **Deep Learning (DL)**: is also known as hierarchical learning. DL is part of the ML methods used in AI. So you can see where the connection is. Altogether is a subset of AI and ML that automatically learn from representations from data such as images, text, without hand-coded rules or human domain knowledge.
  ​
  One of many of the recent breakthroughs of DL in AI is the Google DeepMind's Alpha Go. In October 2015, AlphaGo became the first computer Go program to beat a human professional Go player without handicaps on a full-sized 19×19 board. Read more AlphaGo.

Each one of these concepts has its own strengths and weakness. It all depends on the situation you have at hand and the volume of your data.

​Now you can see how they are interconnected with each other. All of them cannot survive without data.

## Difference between a **Data Analyst** & **Data Scientist**

If you have an analytical mindset and love decoding data to tell a story, you may want to consider a career as a data analyst or data scientist. After all, they are two of the hottest jobs in tech (and pay pretty well, too).

> [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) even awarded “data scientist” the title of “sexiest job of the 21st century.”

> Data science and analytics (DSA) jobs are in high demand. According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/05/13/ibm-predicts-demand-for-data-scientists-will-soar-28-by-2020/#41868bca7e3b), “by 2020 the number of Data Science and Analytics job listings is projected to grow by nearly 364,000 listings to approximately 2,720,000.” They aren’t the easiest positions to fill, either. Forbes goes on to say that DSA jobs “remain open an average of 45 days, five days longer than the market average.”

Even people who have some basic knowledge of data science have confused the data scientist and data analyst roles. So, what’s the difference between a data scientist and a data analyst? Both work with data, but the key difference is what they do with this data.

- **Data analysts** sift through data and seek to identify trends. What stories do the numbers tell? What business decisions can be made based on these insights? They may also create visual representations, such as charts and graphs to better showcase what the data reveals.

- **Data scientists** are pros at interpreting data, but also tend to have coding and mathematical modeling expertise. Most data scientists hold an advanced degree, and many actually went from data analyst to data scientist. They can do the work of a data analyst, but are also hands-on in machine learning, skilled with advanced programming, and can create new processes for data modeling. They can work with algorithms, predictive models, and more.
